## Report on Database usage

*A Startup is launching a new E-commerce platform. The CTO has asked you to investigate Database options that the company can use*

You will be creating a short report to compare NoSQL and SQL databases. The report needs to address the following:

1. **Identify Data Types**
   - What kinds of data do we need to store?

2. **List Database Options**
   - What are some examples of SQL and NoSQL databases?
   - What hosting options are there? (e.g Neon, Supabase)

3. **Compare Features**
   - What can each type of database do?

4. **Check Growth Potential**
   - How well can each database grow as we need more space?

5. **Test Speed**
   - How fast can each database retrieve data?

6. **Tooling**
   - How well does the database type work with other languages?

7. **Consider Future Needs**
   - How easily can we change or expand each database later?

8. **Summarise Findings**
   - What are the main points from our research?
   - which use-case best fits each option?
