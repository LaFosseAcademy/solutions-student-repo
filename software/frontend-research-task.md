## Social Media Feed Application

*A small startup is developing a social media feed application that allows users to create profiles, follow friends, post updates, and like/share posts. The CTO has asked you to research a number of JavaScript front-end frameworks/libraries to help them decide one one*

You will need to create a report comparing **[React](https://react.dev/)**, **[Angular](https://angular.dev/)** and **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)**. Think about what headings you should include and how your report should be structured

Actors:
- User: Interacts with the application to create profiles, posts, and connect with friends.
- Admin: Manages content, users, and application settings.
- Server: Hosts the application and processes requests.

Components:
- User Interface: The front end where users create posts, view feeds, and perform interactions.
- Post Database: Stores user posts, likes, and comments.
- Backend API: Manages user requests and serves data to the UI.
- Notification Service: Sends alerts for likes, follows, and comments.

Events:
- Create Post: A user creates a new post on their profile.
- Like Post: A user likes a friend's post, triggering notifications.
- Comment on Post: A user comments on a post, affecting the feed display.
- Follow User: A user follows another user to see their posts in the feed.

## Bonus
- Try and create a diagram of your chosen system using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or a tool of your choice as part of your report
