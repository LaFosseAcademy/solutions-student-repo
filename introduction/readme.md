*A small team needs a digital task management board that allows users to create tasks, assign them to team members, update their status, and mark them as complete. The board should support real-time updates, enabling team members to see changes instantly while keeping the interface simple and user-friendly.*

For the given scenario create the following:

1. A list of question you would want to ask before starting the project
2. A list of potential Actors for your system
3. A list of events for the system
