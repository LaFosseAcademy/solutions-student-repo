# Comparing Software Architecture

Critque architecture patterns for a particular problem

### Organisation

### Duration

You have **45 mins** to make as much progress on this task as possible.

Make sure to take breaks!

### Team

Group task
## Brief: Design Swap Workshop
For this task, you will be creating an architecture diagram for a simple problem (e.g, a to-do list or a weather app)

## 1. Assign an architecture style (one per team)
- Monolithic
- Layered
- Microservices
- Event driven

## 2. Design sprint (30 mins)
1. **Diagram** – draw a high‑level diagram showing components, data flow, and communication.
2. **Component responsibilities** – write a brief description for each component.
3. **Pros & cons** – list **one advantage** and **one drawback** of the chosen style for this domain.

## 3. Swap diagrams (10 mins)
- Pass your diagram to another team.
- Spend **10 mins** reviewing it: identify missing concerns (e.g., scalability, fault tolerance) and suggest at least one improvement.

## 4. Debrief (5 mins)
- Each team shares key observations: how the architecture affects development speed, deployment complexity, and long term maintenance.
